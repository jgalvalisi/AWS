# Serverless Web Application on AWS

## Project Description:

Based on an AWS workshop, we built in this project a dynamic serverless web application using AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

CHEQUEAR ESTO 
This workshop shows you how to build a dynamic, serverless web application. You'll learn how to host static web resources with Amazon S3, how to use Amazon Cognito to manage users and authentication, and how to build a RESTful API for backend processing using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB.










create an AWS Lambda function that will persist data to an Amazon DynamoDB table.

## Steps to Build the Project:

### 1° Phase - 

* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items.
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files within a bucket (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency.

### 2° Phase - 

### 3° Phase - 

### 4° Phase - 

### 5° Phase - 

### 6° Phase - 


## Expected Outcome:

Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS.
You will have hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront.
Additionally, you will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to create a complete solution.

This project will help you improve your skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
